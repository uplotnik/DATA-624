**Do exercises 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 from the online Hyndman book. **


## Exercise 3.1

Consider the GDP information in global_economy. Plot the GDP per capita for each country over time. Which country has the highest GDP per capita? How has this changed over time?


The `global_economy` dataset contains GDP and Population. 

We will calculate GDP per capita by dividing GDP by Population.
```{r}
global_economy <- global_economy %>%
mutate(GDP_per_capita = GDP / Population)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hchart(
global_economy,
 "line",
hcaes(x = Year, y = GDP_per_capita, group = Country)
) %>%
 hc_title(text = "GDP per capita over time by Country") %>%
hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Year")) %>%
hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "GDP per capita"))
```


I want to take a look at the country with the highest GDP per capita in the most recent year available in the dataset.

```{r}
most_recent_year <- max(global_economy$Year)

highest_gdp_country <- global_economy %>%
  filter(Year == most_recent_year) %>%
  top_n(1, GDP_per_capita) %>%
  pull(Country)

highest_gdp_value <- global_economy %>%
  filter(Year == most_recent_year) %>%
  top_n(1, GDP_per_capita) %>%
  pull(GDP_per_capita)

cat("The country with the highest GDP per capita in", most_recent_year, "is", highest_gdp_country, "with a value of", highest_gdp_value, "\n")
```

Analyze how the GDP per capita has changed over time for the identified country, in our case it's Luxembourg.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
country_data <- global_economy %>%
filter(Country == highest_gdp_country)
hchart(
country_data,
 "line",
hcaes(x = Year, y = GDP_per_capita)

) %>%
 hc_title(text = paste("GDP per capita over time for", highest_gdp_country)) %>%
hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Year")) %>%
hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "GDP per capita"))
```

The chart above shows that Luxembourg had significant GDP growth from 1960 to 2017, culminating in a record GDP per capita of 104,103 in 2017.



## Exercise 3.2

For each of the following series, make a graph of the data. If transforming seems appropriate, do so and describe the effect.

-United States GDP from global_economy.
-Slaughter of Victorian “Bulls, bullocks and steers” in aus_livestock.
-Victorian Electricity Demand from vic_elec.
-Gas production from aus_production.




```{r}
us_gdp <- global_economy %>% filter(Country == "United States")
vic_bulls <- aus_livestock %>% filter(Animal == "Bulls, bullocks and steers", State == "Victoria")
vic_elec_demand <- vic_elec
gas_production <- aus_production
us_gdp
```

1.Analyze United States GDP from global_economy


```{r, echo=FALSE}
hchart(us_gdp, "line", hcaes(x = Year, y = GDP)) %>%
hc_title(text = "United States GDP")

```




The GDP series shows exponential growth, suggesting a log transformation might be useful.

```{r}
us_gdp_transformed <- us_gdp %>%
mutate(log_GDP = log(GDP))
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
hchart(us_gdp_transformed, "line", hcaes(x = Year, y = log_GDP)) %>%
hc_title(text = "Log Transformed United States GDP")
```

The log transformation makes the growth appear more linear and stabilizes the variance.


2.  Analyze Slaughter of Victorian “Bulls, bullocks and steers” in aus_livestock.

```{r}
vic_bulls %>%
  autoplot(Count) +
  ggtitle("Slaughter of Victorian Bulls, bullocks and steers")


```
The series is showing more and more variation as time goes on, which hints that a log transformation could be helpful. 

```{r}
# Apply log transformation
vic_bulls_transformed <- vic_bulls %>%
  mutate(log_Count = log(Count))


vic_bulls_transformed %>%
  autoplot(log_Count) +
  ggtitle("Log Transformed Slaughter of Victorian Bulls, bullocks and steers")
```



The log transformation stabilizes the variance in the slaughter series.

3. Victorian Electricity Demand from vic_elec.

```{r}
vic_elec_demand %>%
  autoplot(Demand) +
  ggtitle("Victorian Electricity Demand")

```

The series seems to have a pretty consistent variance, but we could try a log transformation to check if it makes the series better.


```{r}
# Apply log transformation
vic_elec_demand_transformed <- vic_elec_demand %>%
  mutate(log_Demand = log(Demand))

vic_elec_demand_transformed %>%
  autoplot(log_Demand) +
  ggtitle("Log Transformed Victorian Electricity Demand")

```


The log transformation doesn't drastically change the series, but it might help in stabilizing variance slightly.

```{r}
gas_production %>%
  autoplot(Gas) +
  ggtitle("Gas Production")

```


The gas production series shows exponential growth, suggesting a log transformation might be useful.

```{r}
# log transf
gas_production_transformed <- gas_production %>%
  mutate(log_Gas = log(Gas))

# Plot
gas_production_transformed %>%
  autoplot(log_Gas) +
  ggtitle("Log Transformed Gas Production")

```


Using a log transformation helps to make the growth look more like a straight line and keeps the variance steady.


## Exercise 3.3

Why is a Box-Cox transformation unhelpful for the `canadian_gas` data?


```{r}

gas_data <- canadian_gas
head(gas_data)
```

```{r}
# Calculate optimal lambda

lambda <- gas_data %>%
features(Volume, features = guerrero) %>%
pull(lambda_guerrero)

#Box-Cox transformation

gas_transformed <- gas_data %>%
mutate(box_cox = box_cox(Volume, lambda))
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
hchart1 <- gas_transformed %>%
hchart(type = "line", hcaes(x = Month, y = Volume)) %>%
hc_title(text = "Original Data")
hchart2 <- gas_transformed %>%
hchart(type = "line", hcaes(x = Month, y = box_cox)) %>%
hc_title(text = "Box-Cox Transformed Data")
hw_grid(hchart1, hchart2, ncol = 2)
```

The Box-Cox transformation isn't really useful for the canadian_gas data since it doesn't tackle the main seasonal trends and could make things harder to interpret, all without offering any real benefits for forecasting.

## Exercise 3.4

What Box-Cox transformation would you select for your retail data (from Exercise 7 in Section 2.10)?

```{r}
head(aus_retail)
```



```{r}
# I will select a specific series - "Food retailing"

series_to_analyze <- "Food retailing"
retail_series <- aus_retail %>%
filter(Industry == series_to_analyze)


hchart(retail_series, hcaes(x = Month, y = Turnover), type = "line") %>%
 hc_title(text = paste("Original Retail Series -", series_to_analyze))
```

We apply the `guerrero` method to find the best lambda value for the Box-Cox transformation. This approach picks the lambda that reduces the coefficient of variation for the transformed data.

```{r}
# Determine the optimal Box-Cox transformation parameter (lambda)

lambda <- retail_series %>%
features(Turnover, features = guerrero) %>%
pull(lambda_guerrero)

lambda
```


For box-cox transformation I will use lambda from the Guerrero feature with value of it's 0.30276595.

```{r}
lambda<-0.30276595 
```


```{r}
# Apply the Box-Cox transformation

retail_series_transformed <- retail_series %>%
mutate(Turnover_Transformed = box_cox(Turnover, lambda))
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
hchart(retail_series_transformed, hcaes(x = Month, y = Turnover_Transformed), type = "line") %>%
hc_title(text = paste("Transformed Retail Series -", series_to_analyze))
```


 By displaying the original series next to the transformed one, we can get a good look at the effects of the Box-Cox transformation. The transformed series is expected to show a more uniform variance over time than the original series does.
 
 
 
## Exercise 3.5
 
 For the following series, find an appropriate Box-Cox transformation in order to stabilise the variance. Tobacco from `aus_production`, Economy class passengers between Melbourne and Sydney from `ansett`, and Pedestrian counts at Southern Cross Station from `pedestrian`.
 
 
 
```{r}
# 1. Tobacco data

tobacco_data <- aus_production %>%
select(Quarter, Tobacco)

# 2. Economy class passengers data

economy_data <- ansett %>%
filter(Class == "Economy", Airports == "MEL-SYD") %>%
select(Week, Passengers)

# 3. Pedestrian data

pedestrian_data <- pedestrian %>%
filter(Sensor == "Southern Cross Station") %>%
select(Date, Count)
```
 
 
 
```{r}
# Calculate optimal lambda values

lambda_tobacco <- aus_production %>%
select(Tobacco) %>%
features(Tobacco, features = guerrero) %>%
pull(lambda_guerrero)

lambda_economy <- ansett %>%
filter(Class == "Economy", Airports == "MEL-SYD") %>%
select(Passengers) %>%
features(Passengers, features = guerrero) %>%
pull(lambda_guerrero)

lambda_pedestrian <- pedestrian %>%
filter(Sensor == "Southern Cross Station") %>%
select(Count) %>%
features(Count, features = guerrero) %>%
pull(lambda_guerrero)
```
 
```{r}
lambda_tobacco
```

```{r}
lambda_economy
```

```{r}
lambda_pedestrian
```




```{r}
# Function to create comparison charts

create_comparison_chart <- function(data, original_col, time_col, lambda, title) {

# Original series

original_chart <- highchart() %>%
 hc_title(text = paste("Original", title)) %>%
hc_add_series(data = data,
type = "line",
hcaes(x = !!sym(time_col), y = !!sym(original_col))) %>%
hc_xAxis(title = list(text = time_col)) %>%
 hc_yAxis(title = list(text = original_col))

# Transformed series

transformed_chart <- highchart() %>%
hc_title(text = paste("Box-Cox Transformed", title)) %>%
hc_add_series(data = data,
type = "line",
hcaes(x = !!sym(time_col), 
y = box_cox(!!sym(original_col), lambda))) %>%
hc_xAxis(title = list(text = time_col)) %>%
hc_yAxis(title = list(text = paste("Transformed", original_col)))

return(list(original = original_chart, transformed = transformed_chart))

}
```
 
 
 
```{r}
# Tobacco charts
tobacco_charts <- create_comparison_chart(tobacco_data, "Tobacco", "Quarter", 
                                        lambda_tobacco, "Tobacco Production")
tobacco_charts
```
 


A lambda value λ = 0.9264636 which is close to 1 suggests that the original data is already nearly normally distributed, and the Box-Cox transformation may not significantly alter the data's shape. When lambda equals one, the data shifts down, but the shape does not change. If the optimal value for lambda is one, the data is already normally distributed, making the Box-Cox transformation unnecessary 
 
 
```{r}
# Economy passenger charts
economy_charts <- create_comparison_chart(economy_data, "Passengers", "Week",
                                        lambda_economy, "Economy Passengers")
economy_charts
```





A lambda value  λ = 1.999927 which is greater than 1 suggests that the original data is left-skewed, meaning more observations are around higher values. In this case, the Box-Cox transformation applies a power transformation with lambda > 1 to achieve a more normal distribution





```{r}
# Pedestrian charts
pedestrian_charts <- create_comparison_chart(pedestrian_data, "Count", "Date",
                                           lambda_pedestrian, "Pedestrian Count")
pedestrian_charts
```
 
 
 A negative lambda value λ = -0.2501616 indicates that the data is right-skewed and that the Box-Cox transformation involves an inverse or reciprocal transformation.
 
## Exercise 3.7 
 
Consider the last five years of the Gas data from aus_production.
 

 
```{r}
gas <- tail(aus_production, 5*4) |> select(Gas)

gas_ts <- ts(gas, frequency = 4, start = c(2017, 1)) |> as_tsibble()
head(gas_ts)
```
 
 a. Plot the time series. Can you identify seasonal fluctuations and/or a trend-cycle? 
 
```{r,echo=F}
hchart(gas_ts, hcaes(x = index, y = value), type = 'line') |>
  hc_title(text = "Gas Production Time Series") |>
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Quarter")) |>
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Gas Production"))|>
  hc_size(height = 500, width = 500)
```
 
 The graph presented above illustrates distinct seasonal fluctuations alongside a production trend in the data pertaining to Australian gas production over the past five years.



 b. Use classical_decomposition with type=multiplicative to calculate the trend-cycle and seasonal indices.
 
 
 
```{r}
decomp <- gas_ts |>
  model(classical_decomposition(value, type = "multiplicative")) |>
  components()

print(decomp)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
hchart(decomp, hcaes(x = index, y = value), type = 'line') |>
  hc_title(text = "Gas") |>
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Quarter")) |>
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Gas"))|>
  hc_size(height = 500, width = 500)

hchart(decomp, hcaes(x = index, y = seasonal), type = 'line') |>
  hc_title(text = "Seasonal Component") |>
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Quarter")) |>
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Seasonal"))|>
  hc_size(height = 500, width = 500)

hchart(decomp, hcaes(x = index, y = trend), type = 'line') |>
  hc_title(text = "Trend Component") |>
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Quarter")) |>
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Trend"))|>
  hc_size(height = 500, width = 500)

hchart(decomp, hcaes(x = index, y = random), type = 'line') |>
  hc_title(text = "Random Component") |>
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Quarter")) |>
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Random"))|>
  hc_size(height = 500, width = 500)
```
 
 c. Do the results support the graphical interpretation from part a?
  The components validate the conclusions drawn in Part A concerning the upward trajectory and the seasonal variations observed. Furthermore, the data does not exhibit significant randomness.
  
 d. Compute and plot the seasonally adjusted data. 
  
```{r}
adjusted_gas <- gas_ts |>
  mutate(
    adj_gas = value / decomp$seasonal
  )

hchart(adjusted_gas, hcaes(x = index, y = adj_gas), type = 'line') |>
  hc_title(text = "Seasonally Adjusted Gas Production") |>
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Quarter")) |>
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Gas Production (Seasonally Adjusted)"))|>
  hc_size(height = 500, width = 500)
```
  
 
 
 e.Change one observation to be an outlier (e.g., add 300 to one observation), and recompute the seasonally adjusted data. What is the effect of the outlier?
 
 
```{r}
gas_ts_outlier <- gas_ts
gas_ts_outlier$value[10] <- gas_ts_outlier$value[10] + 300

decomp_outlier <- gas_ts_outlier |>
  model(classical_decomposition(value, type = "multiplicative")) |>
  components()

adjusted_gas_outlier <- gas_ts_outlier |>
  mutate(
    adj_gas = value / decomp_outlier$seasonal
  )


hchart(adjusted_gas_outlier, hcaes(x = index, y = adj_gas), type = 'line') |>
  hc_title(text = "Seasonally Adjusted Gas Production with Outlier") |>
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Quarter")) |>
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Gas Production (Seasonally Adjusted)"))|>
  hc_size(height = 500, width = 500)
```
 
 The presence of the outlier significantly alters the seasonally adjusted data. The advantages of utilizing seasonally adjusted figures are negated, as the underlying trend becomes indiscernible. This outlier, positioned centrally within the dataset, manifests prominently at the onset of the seasonally adjusted data visualization.
 
 
 
f. Does it make any difference if the outlier is near the end rather than in the middle of the time series?


```{r}
gas_ts_outlier_end <- gas_ts
gas_ts_outlier_end$value[20] <- gas_ts_outlier_end$value[20] + 300

decomp_outlier_end <- gas_ts_outlier_end |>
  model(classical_decomposition(value, type = "multiplicative")) |>
  components()

adjusted_gas_outlier_end <- gas_ts_outlier_end |>
  mutate(
    adj_gas = value / decomp_outlier_end$seasonal
  )
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
hchart(adjusted_gas_outlier_end, hcaes(x = index, y = adj_gas), type = 'line') |>
  hc_title(text = "Seasonally Adjusted Gas Production with Outlier at End") |>
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Quarter")) |>
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Gas Production (Seasonally Adjusted)"))|>
  hc_size(height = 500, width = 500)
```

Comparing the results with the outlier in the middle, we can determine if the outlier's position affects the seasonally adjusted data differently.  Classical decomposition methods are sensitive to outliers, and their impact can vary depending on the outlier's location within the time series.


The effect of the outlier is that it distorts the seasonal indices, which in turn affects the seasonally adjusted data. The impact of the outlier depends on its position within the time series.



## Exercise 3.8


Recall your retail time series data (from Exercise 7 in Section 2.10). Decompose the series using X-11. Does it reveal any outliers, or unusual features that you had not noticed previously?

```{r}
library(seasonal)

```

```{r}
set.seed(12345678)
myseries <- aus_retail |>
  filter(`Series ID` == sample(aus_retail$`Series ID`,1))
```

```{r}
x11 <- myseries %>%
        model(x11 = X_13ARIMA_SEATS(Turnover ~ x11())) %>%
  components()

x11
```

```{r}
autoplot(x11)
```


## Exercise 3.9


Figures 3.19 and 3.20 show the result of decomposing the number of persons in the civilian labour force in Australia each month from February 1978 to August 1995.

```{r, out.width ="500px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/ulianaplotnikova/Desktop/Data622/Pic1.png")
```

```{r, out.width ="500px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/ulianaplotnikova/Desktop/Data622/Pic2.png")
```




The figures presented illustrate the decomposition of the Australian civilian labor force from February 1978 to August 1995, employing the STL method. This decomposition categorizes the data into three distinct components: trend, seasonal, and remainder.

In Figure 3.19, the original data (value) is depicted alongside the long-term trend, seasonal variations (season_year), and the residual fluctuations (remainder). The trend component indicates a consistent upward trajectory in the labor force over the observed period. The seasonal component highlights predictable annual patterns, which likely correspond to variations in seasonal employment. The remainder component captures short-term, irregular fluctuations.

Figure 3.20 emphasizes the seasonal component, providing a clearer representation of the cyclical patterns. The interpretation of these graphs is significantly influenced by the differing scales on the y-axis between the original data and the decomposed components.

The recession of 1991/1992 is not distinctly observable within the estimated components. Although the remainder component exhibits some negative fluctuations during this timeframe, these variations are not markedly larger than other fluctuations throughout the series. The overarching trend continues to rise, thereby obscuring the recession's impact on the decomposed components.
